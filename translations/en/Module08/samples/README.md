# Module 08 Samples: Foundry Local Development Guide

## Overview

This detailed collection demonstrates both the **Foundry Local SDK** and **Shell Command** methods for creating production-ready AI applications. Each example highlights various aspects of edge AI development, ranging from basic REST integration to advanced multi-agent systems.

## Development Approach: SDK vs Shell Commands

### Use Foundry Local SDK When:

- **Programmatic Control**: You require complete control over agent lifecycle, evaluation, or deployment workflows.
- **Custom Tooling**: Developing automation around Foundry Local (e.g., CI/CD integration, multi-agent orchestration).
- **Fine-Grained Access**: Need detailed agent metadata, versioning, or control over evaluation runners.
- **Python Integration**: Working in Python-centric environments or embedding Foundry logic into larger applications.
- **Enterprise Workflows**: Implementing modular workflows and reproducible evaluation pipelines aligned with Microsoft's reference architectures.

### Use Shell Commands When:

- **Quick Testing**: Conducting rapid local tests, manually launching agents, or verifying setups.
- **CLI Simplicity**: Requiring straightforward CLI operations for starting/stopping agents, checking logs, or performing basic evaluations.
- **Lightweight Automation**: Writing simple scripts for automation without needing full SDK integration.
- **Rapid Iteration**: Debugging and development cycles, especially in constrained environments or deployments at the resource group level.
- **Setup & Validation**: Configuring the environment and performing quick verification tasks.

## Best Practices & Recommended Workflow

Following principles of agent lifecycle management, dependency tracking, and reproducibility with minimal privileges:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
1. **Begin with Shell Commands** for initial setup and quick validation.
2. **Verify Environment** using CLI tools and basic model deployment.
3. **Test Connectivity** with simple REST calls and health checks.

### Phase 2: Development & Integration
1. **Switch to SDK** for scalable and traceable workflows.
2. **Enable Programmatic Control** for handling complex agent interactions.
3. **Develop Custom Tools** for community-ready templates and Azure OpenAI integration.

### Phase 3: Production & Scale
1. **Adopt a Hybrid Approach** using CLI for operations and SDK for application logic.
2. **Enterprise Integration** with monitoring, logging, and deployment pipelines.
3. **Contribute to the Community** by sharing reusable templates and best practices.
