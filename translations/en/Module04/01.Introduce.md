## Understanding Model Quantization Boundaries and Classifications

Model quantization is a method aimed at reducing the precision of neural network parameters, using significantly fewer bits compared to full-precision models. While full-precision models rely on 32-bit floating-point representations, quantized models are specifically designed for efficiency and deployment on edge devices.

The precision classification framework helps categorize quantization levels and their ideal use cases. This framework is essential for selecting the appropriate precision level for specific edge computing scenarios.

### Precision Classification Framework

Understanding precision boundaries is key to choosing the right quantization levels for various edge computing scenarios:

- **üî¨ Ultra-Low Precision**: 1-bit to 2-bit quantization (extreme compression for specialized hardware)
