    "- **FoundryLocalManager** - Initializes and manages the Foundry Local service\n",
    "- **Auto-Detection** - Automatically discovers the endpoint and handles the service lifecycle\n",
    "- **Model Resolution** - Resolves aliases to full model IDs (e.g., phi-4-mini ‚Üí phi-4-mini-instruct-cpu)\n",
    "- **Hardware Optimization** - Selects the best variant for available hardware (CUDA, NPU, or CPU)\n",
    "- **OpenAI Client** - Configured with the manager's endpoint for OpenAI-compatible API access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resilience Features:**\n",
    "- Exponential backoff retry logic (configurable via environment)\n",
    "- Automatic service startup if not running\n",
    "- Connection verification after initialization\n",
    "- Graceful error handling with detailed error reporting\n",
    "- Model caching to avoid repeated initialization\n",

    "**Result Structure:**\n",

    "**Key Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Latency**: Lower values are better - indicates faster response times\n",

    "**When to Use SLM vs LLM:**\n",

    "2. Explore other model combinations\n",
