## Common Issues and Solutions

### üî¥ CUDA Out of Memory

**Error Message:**
```
CUDA failure 2: out of memory
```
  
**Root Cause:** The GPU does not have enough VRAM to load the model.

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Use CPU Variants (Recommended)
```python
# In your notebook, update the CATALOG to use CPU variants
CATALOG = {
    'phi-4-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['general','summarize'],'priority':2},
    'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['code','refactor'],'priority':3},
}
```
  
#### Option 2: Use Smaller Models on GPU
```python
# Use only the smallest model
CATALOG = {
    'qwen2.5-0.5b': {'capabilities':['general','code','summarize','classification'],'priority':1},
}
```
  
#### Option 3: Clear GPU Memory
```bash
# Close other GPU-intensive applications
# Check GPU memory usage
nvidia-smi

# Restart Foundry Local service
foundry service stop
foundry service start
```
  
#### Option 4: Increase GPU Memory (if possible)
- Close browser tabs, video editors, or other GPU-intensive applications.
- Reduce Windows visual effects.
- Use a dedicated GPU if you have both integrated and dedicated GPUs.

### üî¥ APIConnectionError: Connection Error

**Error Message:**
```
APIConnectionError: Connection error
[Retry 1/2] Setup failed for 'phi-4-mini': APIConnectionError: Connection error.
```
  
**Root Cause:** The Foundry Local service is not running or is inaccessible.

**Solutions:**

#### Step 1: Check Service Status
```bash
foundry service status
```
  
#### Step 2: Start Service if Stopped
```bash
foundry service start
```
  
#### Step 3: Verify Endpoint
```bash
# Check what port the service is using
foundry service status

# Test with curl (adjust port if different)
curl http://localhost:59959/health
curl http://localhost:55769/health
```
  
#### Step 4: Load Required Models
```bash
foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
foundry model run phi-3.5-mini
```
  
#### Step 5: Restart Notebook Kernel  
After starting the service and loading models, restart the notebook kernel and re-run all cells.

### üî¥ Model Not Found in Catalog

**Error Message:**
```
ValueError: Model phi-3.5-mini-cpu not found in the catalog.
[ERROR] Model 'phi-4-mini' not found in the catalog
```
  
**Root Cause:** The model is not downloaded or loaded in Foundry Local.

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Download and Load Models
```bash
# List available models
foundry model ls

# Download the model if not present
foundry model download phi-4-mini
foundry model download qwen2.5-3b
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini

# Load the model into memory
foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
foundry model run phi-3.5-mini
```
  
#### Option 2: Use Auto-Selection Mode  
Update your CATALOG to use base model names (without the `-cpu` suffix):

```python
CATALOG = {
    'phi-4-mini': {'capabilities':['general','summarize'],'priority':2},
    'qwen2.5-0.5b': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini': {'capabilities':['code','refactor'],'priority':3},
}
```
  
Foundry Local SDK will automatically select the best variant (CPU, GPU, or NPU) for your hardware.

### üî¥ HttpResponseError: 500 - Failed Loading Model

**Error Message:**
```
HttpResponseError: 500 - Failed loading model
```
  
**Root Cause:** The model file is corrupted or incompatible with the hardware.

**Solutions:**

#### Redownload Model
```bash
# Remove corrupted model
foundry model remove phi-3.5-mini

# Download fresh copy
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini
```
  
#### Use Different Variant
```bash
# Try CPU variant instead
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini-cpu
```
  

---

### üî¥ ImportError: No Module Found

**Error Message:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foundry_local'
```
  
**Root Cause:** The `foundry-local-sdk` package is not installed.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Install SDK
pip install foundry-local-sdk

# Verify installation
pip show foundry-local-sdk
python -c "from foundry_local import FoundryLocalManager; print('SDK OK')"
```
  

---

### ÔøΩ Slow First Request

**Symptom:** The first completion takes 30+ seconds, while subsequent requests are faster.

**Root Cause:** This is expected behavior‚Äîthe service is loading the model into memory during the first request.

**Solutions:**

#### Pre-load Models
```bash
# Download and load all models you'll use before running notebooks
foundry model download phi-4-mini
foundry model download qwen2.5-3b
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini

foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
```
  
#### Keep Service Running
```bash
# Start service manually and leave it running
foundry service start
```

## Session 04 Specific Issues

### Wrong Port Configuration

**Issue:** The notebook is connecting to the wrong port (e.g., 55769 vs 59959 vs 57127).

**Solution:**

1. Check which port Foundry Local is using:
```bash
foundry service status
# Note the port number displayed
```
  
2. Update Cell 10 in the notebook:
```python
ENDPOINT = os.getenv('FOUNDRY_LOCAL_ENDPOINT', 'http://localhost:59959/v1')
# Replace 59959 with your actual port
```
  
3. Restart the kernel and re-run cells 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 22.

---

### Wrong Model Selection

**Issue:** The notebook is showing `gpt-oss-20b` or `qwen2.5-7b` instead of `qwen2.5-3b`.

**Solution:**

1. Restart the notebook kernel (to clear old variable states).
2. Re-run Cell 10 (Set Model Aliases).
3. Re-run Cell 12 (Display Configuration).
4. **Verify:** Cell 12 should display `LLM Model: qwen2.5-3b`.

---

### Diagnostic Cell Fails

**Issue:** Cell 16 shows "‚ùå Foundry Local service not found!"

**Solution:**

1. Verify the service is running:
```bash
foundry service status
```
  
2. Test the endpoint manually:
```bash
curl http://localhost:59959/v1/models
```
  
3. If `curl` works but the notebook does not:
   - Restart the notebook kernel.
   - Re-run cells in order: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.

4. If `curl` fails:
   - Start the service: `foundry service start`.
   - Load models: `foundry model run phi-4-mini` and `foundry model run qwen2.5-3b`.

---

### Pre-flight Check Fails

**Issue:** Cell 20 shows connection errors even though diagnostics passed.

**Solution:**

1. Check if models are loaded:
```bash
foundry model ls
# Should show phi-4-mini and qwen2.5-3b
```
  
2. If models are missing:
```bash
foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
```
  
3. Re-run Cell 20 after models are loaded.

---

### Comparison Fails with None Values

**Issue:** Cell 22 completes but shows latency as `None`.

**Solution:**

1. Ensure the pre-flight check passed first (Cell 20).
2. Re-run Cell 22‚Äîmodels may need to warm up during the first request.
3. Verify both models are loaded: `foundry model ls`.

---

## Session 05 Specific Issues

### Agent Using Wrong Model

**Issue:** The agent is not using the expected model.

**Solution:**

Verify the configuration:
```python
# Check which models are assigned
print(f"Researcher: {researcher.model_id}")
print(f"Editor: {editor.model_id}")
```
  
Restart the kernel if the models are incorrect.

---

### Memory Context Overflow

**Issue:** Agent responses degrade over time.

**Solution:** This is already handled automatically‚Äîagents retain only the last 6 messages in memory.

---

## Session 06 Specific Issues

### CPU vs GPU Model Confusion

**Issue:** CUDA errors occur when using the default configuration.

**Solution:** The default configuration now uses CPU models. If you encounter CUDA errors:

1. Verify you are using the default CPU catalog:
```python
# Cell should show CPU variants
CATALOG = {
    'phi-4-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['general','summarize'],'priority':2},
    'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['code','refactor'],'priority':3},
}
```
  
2. Restart the kernel and re-run all cells.

---

### Intent Detection Not Working

**Issue:** Prompts are being routed to the wrong models.

**Solution:**

Test intent detection:
```python
# Run the intent detection test cell
for prompt in test_prompts:
    intent = detect_intent(prompt)
    print(f"{prompt[:50]}... ‚Üí {intent}")
```
  
Update RULES if patterns need adjustment.

---

## Hardware-Specific Issues

### NVIDIA GPU

**Check GPU Status:**
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
  
**Common Issues:**
- **Driver outdated:** Update NVIDIA drivers.
- **CUDA version mismatch:** Reinstall Foundry Local.
- **GPU memory fragmented:** Restart the system.

### Qualcomm NPU

**Check NPU Status:**
```bash
foundry device info
```
  
**Common Issues:**
- **NPU drivers not installed:** Install Qualcomm NPU drivers.
- **NPU variant not available:** Use the CPU variant.
- **Windows version too old:** Update to the latest Windows 11.

### CPU-Only Systems

**Recommended Models:**
```python
CATALOG = {
    'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['code','general'],'priority':2},
}
```
  
**Performance Tips:**
- Use the smallest models.
- Reduce `max_tokens`.
- Be patient with the first request.

## Prevention Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Always check the service first:**
   ```bash
   foundry service status
   ```
  
2. **Use CPU variants by default:**
   ```python
   CATALOG = {
       'phi-4-mini-cpu': {...},
       'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {...},
   }
   ```
  
3. **Pre-load models before running notebooks:**
   ```bash
   foundry model run phi-4-mini
   foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
   ```
  
4. **Keep the service running:**
   - Avoid stopping/starting the service unnecessarily.
   - Let it run in the background between sessions.

5. **Monitor resources:**
   - Check GPU memory before running.
   - Close unnecessary GPU applications.
   - Use Task Manager or `nvidia-smi`.

6. **Update regularly:**
   ```bash
   winget upgrade Microsoft.FoundryLocal
   pip install --upgrade foundry-local-sdk
   ```
