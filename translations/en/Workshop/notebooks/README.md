### Installation Steps

#### 1. Install Foundry Local

**Windows**:
```cmd
winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal
```

**macOS**:
```bash
brew tap microsoft/foundrylocal
brew install foundrylocal
```

**Verify Installation**:
```bash
foundry --version
```

#### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Navigate to Workshop directory
cd Workshop

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Start Foundry Local

```bash
# Load a model (auto-downloads if needed)
foundry model run phi-4-mini

# Verify service is running
foundry service status
```

#### 4. Launch Jupyter

```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/

# Or use VS Code with Jupyter extension
code notebooks/
```

### Quick Verification

Run this in a Python cell to verify setup:

```python
from foundry_local import FoundryLocalManager
import openai

# Initialize manager (auto-discovers service)
manager = FoundryLocalManager("phi-4-mini")

# Configure OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url=manager.endpoint,
    api_key=manager.api_key
)

# Test chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=manager.get_model_info("phi-4-mini").id,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Expected Output**: A greeting response from the local model.

## 📝 Workshop Best Practices

### For Instructors

**Before the Workshop**:
- ✅ Send installation instructions one week in advance
- ✅ Test all notebooks on the target hardware
- ✅ Prepare a troubleshooting guide for common issues
- ✅ Have backup models ready (phi-3.5-mini if phi-4-mini fails)
- ✅ Set up a shared chat channel for questions

**During the Workshop**:
- ✅ Start with a quick environment check (5 minutes)
- ✅ Share troubleshooting resources immediately
- ✅ Encourage experimentation and modifications
- ✅ Use breaks strategically (after every two sessions)
- ✅ Have TAs available for one-on-one help

**After the Workshop**:
- ✅ Share complete working notebooks and solutions
- ✅ Provide links to additional resources
- ✅ Create a feedback survey for improvement
- ✅ Offer office hours for follow-up questions

### For Learners

**Maximize Your Learning**:
- ✅ Complete setup before the workshop starts
- ✅ Run every code cell yourself (don’t just read)
- ✅ Experiment with parameters and prompts
- ✅ Take notes on insights and challenges
- ✅ Ask questions when stuck (others likely have the same question)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- ❌ Skipping cell execution order (run sequentially)
- ❌ Not reading error messages carefully
- ❌ Rushing through without understanding
- ❌ Ignoring markdown explanations
- ❌ Not saving your modified notebooks

**Debugging Tips**:
1. **Service Not Running**: Check `foundry service status`
2. **Import Errors**: Verify the virtual environment is activated
3. **Model Not Found**: Run `foundry model ls` to list loaded models
4. **Slow Performance**: Check RAM usage, close other applications
5. **Unexpected Results**: Restart the kernel and run all cells from the top
