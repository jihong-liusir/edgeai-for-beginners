## [4. EdgeAI with Windows ML](./windowdeveloper.md)

Windows ML is Microsoft's advanced runtime optimized for efficient on-device model inference and simplified deployment, forming the foundation of Windows AI Foundry. It allows developers to create AI-powered Windows applications that leverage the full range of PC hardware.

### Platform Capabilities
- Compatible with all Windows 11 PCs running version 24H2 (build 26100) or later
- Works on all x64 and ARM64 PC hardware, even devices without NPUs or GPUs
- Enables developers to bring their own models and deploy them efficiently across the silicon partner ecosystem, including AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm, spanning CPU, GPU, and NPU
- Infrastructure APIs eliminate the need for multiple app builds targeting different hardware

### Developer Benefits
Windows ML abstracts hardware and execution providers, allowing developers to focus on coding. It automatically updates to support the latest NPUs, GPUs, and CPUs as they are released. The platform offers a unified framework for AI development across the diverse Windows hardware ecosystem.

## [5. EdgeAI with Foundry Local Applications](./foundrylocal.md)

Foundry Local enables Windows and Mac developers to create Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using local resources in .NET, combining local language models with semantic search capabilities. This approach delivers privacy-focused AI solutions that operate entirely on local infrastructure.

### Technical Architecture
- Integrates the Phi language model, Local Embeddings, and Semantic Kernel to build a RAG scenario
- Uses embeddings as vectors (arrays) of floating-point values representing content and its semantic meaning
- Semantic Kernel acts as the main orchestrator, combining Phi and Smart Components to create a seamless RAG pipeline
- Supports local vector databases like SQLite and Qdrant

### Implementation Benefits
RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, essentially means "retrieving relevant information and incorporating it into the prompt." This local implementation ensures data privacy while providing intelligent responses based on custom knowledge bases. It's particularly useful for enterprise scenarios requiring data sovereignty and offline functionality.
