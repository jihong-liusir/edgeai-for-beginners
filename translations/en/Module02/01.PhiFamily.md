## Practical Examples and Use Cases

Before exploring the technical evolution, let's look at some practical examples of what Phi models can achieve:

### Mathematical Reasoning Example

Phi-4-mini-reasoning excels at step-by-step mathematical problem solving. For instance, when asked "How to solve 3*x^2+4*x+5=1?", the model provides detailed reasoning steps:

```
<|system|>Your name is Phi, an AI math expert developed by Microsoft.<|end|>
<|user|>How to solve 3*x^2+4*x+5=1?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
I need to solve the quadratic equation 3x² + 4x + 5 = 1.

First, let me rearrange this to standard form:
3x² + 4x + 5 = 1
3x² + 4x + 5 - 1 = 0  
3x² + 4x + 4 = 0

Now I can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
Where a = 3, b = 4, c = 4

Let me calculate the discriminant:
b² - 4ac = 4² - 4(3)(4) = 16 - 48 = -32

Since the discriminant is negative (-32), this equation has no real solutions.
The solutions are complex: x = (-4 ± √(-32)) / 6 = (-4 ± 4i√2) / 6 = (-2 ± 2i√2) / 3
```

### Multilingual Support Example

Phi-3.5-mini-instruct demonstrates strong multilingual capabilities across various languages. Here's an example prompt format:

```
<|system|>You are a helpful assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>How to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Imagine, good sir knight, a vast network of invisible roads that span the entire realm and beyond. The Internet is like a magical system of messenger birds that can carry any message - be it text, images, or even moving pictures - instantly to any castle, village, or hamlet in the world.

Think of it as if every scribe's work could be copied and shared with thousands of people simultaneously, as if you could visit any library in any kingdom without leaving your chambers, or as if you could hold council with knights from distant lands as if they were sitting at your very table.

This "Internet" allows people to:
- Send messages faster than the swiftest horse
- Access knowledge from scholars across all kingdoms
- Trade goods without traveling to distant markets
- Share stories and news from lands you've never seen

'Tis like having a thousand scribes, merchants, and storytellers all working for you at once, good knight!
```

### Multimodal Capabilities Example
