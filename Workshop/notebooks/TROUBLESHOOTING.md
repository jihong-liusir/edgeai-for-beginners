## Common Issues and Solutions

### üî¥ CUDA Out of Memory

**Error Message:**
```
CUDA failure 2: out of memory
```

**Root Cause:** GPU doesn't have enough VRAM to load the model.

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Use CPU Variants (Recommended)
```python
# In your notebook, update the CATALOG to use CPU variants
CATALOG = {
    'phi-4-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['general','summarize'],'priority':2},
    'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['code','refactor'],'priority':3},
}
```

#### Option 2: Use Smaller Models on GPU
```python
# Use only the smallest model
CATALOG = {
    'qwen2.5-0.5b': {'capabilities':['general','code','summarize','classification'],'priority':1},
}
```

#### Option 3: Clear GPU Memory
```bash
# Close other GPU-intensive applications
# Check GPU memory usage
nvidia-smi

# Restart Foundry Local service
foundry service stop
foundry service start
```

#### Option 4: Increase GPU Memory (if possible)
- Close browser tabs, video editors, or other GPU apps
- Reduce Windows visual effects
- Use dedicated GPU if you have integrated + dedicated

### üî¥ APIConnectionError: Connection Error

**Error Message:**
```
APIConnectionError: Connection error
[Retry 1/2] Setup failed for 'phi-4-mini': APIConnectionError: Connection error.
```

**Root Cause:** Foundry Local service is not running or not accessible.

**Solutions:**

#### Step 1: Check Service Status
```bash
foundry service status
```

#### Step 2: Start Service if Stopped
```bash
foundry service start
```

#### Step 3: Verify Endpoint
```bash
# Check what port the service is using
foundry service status

# Test with curl (adjust port if different)
curl http://localhost:59959/health
curl http://localhost:55769/health
```

#### Step 4: Load Required Models
```bash
foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
foundry model run phi-3.5-mini
```

#### Step 5: Restart Notebook Kernel
After starting the service and loading models, restart the notebook kernel and re-run all cells.

### üî¥ Model Not Found in Catalog

**Error Message:**
```
ValueError: Model phi-3.5-mini-cpu not found in the catalog.
[ERROR] Model 'phi-4-mini' not found in the catalog
```

**Root Cause:** Model isn't downloaded or loaded in Foundry Local.

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Download and Load Models
```bash
# List available models
foundry model ls

# Download the model if not present
foundry model download phi-4-mini
foundry model download qwen2.5-3b
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini

# Load the model into memory
foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
foundry model run phi-3.5-mini
```

#### Option 2: Use Auto-Selection Mode
Update your CATALOG to use base model names (without `-cpu` suffix):

```python
CATALOG = {
    'phi-4-mini': {'capabilities':['general','summarize'],'priority':2},
    'qwen2.5-0.5b': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini': {'capabilities':['code','refactor'],'priority':3},
}
```

Foundry Local SDK will automatically select the best variant (CPU, GPU, or NPU) for your hardware.

### üî¥ HttpResponseError: 500 - Failed Loading Model

**Error Message:**
```
HttpResponseError: 500 - Failed loading model
```

**Root Cause:** Model file is corrupted or incompatible with hardware.

**Solutions:**

#### Redownload Model
```bash
# Remove corrupted model
foundry model remove phi-3.5-mini

# Download fresh copy
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini
```

#### Use Different Variant
```bash
# Try CPU variant instead
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini-cpu
```

---

### üî¥ ImportError: No Module Found

**Error Message:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foundry_local'
```

**Root Cause:** foundry-local-sdk package not installed.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Install SDK
pip install foundry-local-sdk

# Verify installation
pip show foundry-local-sdk
python -c "from foundry_local import FoundryLocalManager; print('SDK OK')"
```

---

### ÔøΩ Slow First Request

**Symptom:** First completion takes 30+ seconds, subsequent requests are fast.

**Root Cause:** This is normal behavior - the service is loading the model into memory on first request.

**Solutions:**

#### Pre-load Models
```bash
# Download and load all models you'll use before running notebooks
foundry model download phi-4-mini
foundry model download qwen2.5-3b
foundry model download phi-3.5-mini

foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
```

#### Keep Service Running
```bash
# Start service manually and leave it running
foundry service start
```

## Session 04 Specific Issues

### Wrong Port Configuration

**Issue:** Notebook connecting to wrong port (55769 vs 59959 vs 57127)

**Solution:**

1. Check which port Foundry Local is using:
```bash
foundry service status
# Note the port number displayed
```

2. Update Cell 10 in the notebook:
```python
ENDPOINT = os.getenv('FOUNDRY_LOCAL_ENDPOINT', 'http://localhost:59959/v1')
# Replace 59959 with your actual port
```

3. Restart kernel and re-run cells 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 22

---

### Wrong Model Selection

**Issue:** Notebook showing gpt-oss-20b or qwen2.5-7b instead of qwen2.5-3b

**Solution:**

1. Restart notebook kernel (clears old variable state)
2. Re-run Cell 10 (Set Model Aliases)
3. Re-run Cell 12 (Display Configuration)
4. **Verify:** Cell 12 should show `LLM Model: qwen2.5-3b`

---

### Diagnostic Cell Fails

**Issue:** Cell 16 shows "‚ùå Foundry Local service not found!"

**Solution:**

1. Verify service is running:
```bash
foundry service status
```

2. Test endpoint manually:
```bash
curl http://localhost:59959/v1/models
```

3. If curl works but notebook doesn't:
   - Restart notebook kernel
   - Re-run cells in order: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

4. If curl fails:
   - Start service: `foundry service start`
   - Load models: `foundry model run phi-4-mini` and `foundry model run qwen2.5-3b`

---

### Pre-flight Check Fails

**Issue:** Cell 20 shows connection errors even though diagnostic passed

**Solution:**

1. Check models are loaded:
```bash
foundry model ls
# Should show phi-4-mini and qwen2.5-3b
```

2. If models missing:
```bash
foundry model run phi-4-mini
foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
```

3. Re-run Cell 20 after models are loaded

---

### Comparison Fails with None Values

**Issue:** Cell 22 completes but shows latency as None

**Solution:**

1. Check that pre-flight passed first (Cell 20)
2. Re-run Cell 22 - models may need to warm up on first request
3. Verify both models are loaded: `foundry model ls`

---

## Session 05 Specific Issues

### Agent Using Wrong Model

**Issue:** Agent not using expected model

**Solution:**

Verify configuration:
```python
# Check which models are assigned
print(f"Researcher: {researcher.model_id}")
print(f"Editor: {editor.model_id}")
```

Restart kernel if models are incorrect.

---

### Memory Context Overflow

**Issue:** Agent responses degrading over time

**Solution:** Already handled automatically - agents keep only last 6 messages in memory.

---

## Session 06 Specific Issues

### CPU vs GPU Model Confusion

**Issue:** Getting CUDA errors when using default configuration

**Solution:** The default configuration now uses CPU models. If you see CUDA errors:

1. Verify you're using the default CPU catalog:
```python
# Cell should show CPU variants
CATALOG = {
    'phi-4-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['general','summarize'],'priority':2},
    'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['code','refactor'],'priority':3},
}
```

2. Restart kernel and re-run all cells

---

### Intent Detection Not Working

**Issue:** Prompts being routed to wrong models

**Solution:**

Test intent detection:
```python
# Run the intent detection test cell
for prompt in test_prompts:
    intent = detect_intent(prompt)
    print(f"{prompt[:50]}... ‚Üí {intent}")
```

Update RULES if patterns need adjustment.

---

## Hardware-Specific Issues

### NVIDIA GPU

**Check GPU Status:**
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Driver outdated**: Update NVIDIA drivers
- **CUDA version mismatch**: Reinstall Foundry Local
- **GPU memory fragmented**: Restart system

### Qualcomm NPU

**Check NPU Status:**
```bash
foundry device info
```

**Common Issues:**
- **NPU drivers not installed**: Install Qualcomm NPU drivers
- **NPU variant not available**: Use CPU variant
- **Windows version too old**: Update to latest Windows 11

### CPU-Only Systems

**Recommended Models:**
```python
CATALOG = {
    'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {'capabilities':['classification','fast'],'priority':1},
    'phi-3.5-mini-cpu': {'capabilities':['code','general'],'priority':2},
}
```

**Performance Tips:**
- Use smallest models
- Reduce max_tokens
- Increase patience for first request

## Prevention Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Always check service first:**
   ```bash
   foundry service status
   ```

2. **Use CPU variants by default:**
   ```python
   CATALOG = {
       'phi-4-mini-cpu': {...},
       'qwen2.5-0.5b-cpu': {...},
   }
   ```

3. **Pre-load models before running notebooks:**
   ```bash
   foundry model run phi-4-mini
   foundry model run qwen2.5-3b
   ```

4. **Keep service running:**
   - Don't stop/start service unnecessarily
   - Let it run in background between sessions

5. **Monitor resources:**
   - Check GPU memory before running
   - Close unnecessary GPU applications
   - Use Task Manager / nvidia-smi

6. **Update regularly:**
   ```bash
   winget upgrade Microsoft.FoundryLocal
   pip install --upgrade foundry-local-sdk
   ```
